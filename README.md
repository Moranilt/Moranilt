Hi, I’m Daniel!

I’m interested in new features of programming world and create something incredible to improve this world. 
Most of all I'd like to improve my skills in **Golang**(exactly backend) and create my own application architecture.

I believe in hard work to be better than others. You can become better if you have a discipline in your life. 
I'm learning something new and improving my skills every day because time is going away too fast and I want to change this world, 
give something greate to other people.

I have huge experience in front-end development(Typescript, React, NextJS). 
I've made my own library of components(TS, React, Babel, Storybook) at the company to make front-end development 
more convenient and also to help designers to systemize their templates using components.

I have a huge experience in project design, I like to create "rules" for developers which will help them do their job more efficiently. 

I like to develope tools because I know what developers need and how are you feeling when you need some simple tools which you can't find, that's why I want to show everyone that happiness is in simple things.
